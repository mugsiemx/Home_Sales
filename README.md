![House Keys](https://github.com/mugsiemx/Home_Sales/blob/main/Images/pexels-oleksandr-pidvalnyi-7599735.jpg)

In this challenge, we use our knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then we use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

# The required questions answered as follows:

1- What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

2- What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

3- What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

4- What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query, and round off your answer to two decimal places.
